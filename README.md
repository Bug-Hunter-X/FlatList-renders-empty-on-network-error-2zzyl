# React Native FlatList Empty Render on Network Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component renders empty when a network request fails.  The provided code snippet shows how to handle this gracefully by displaying an error message if the network request is unsuccessful.

## Problem

The original `MyComponent` attempts to fetch data from a remote API. If the network request fails (e.g., due to a network outage or invalid URL), the FlatList renders empty, providing no feedback to the user about the error.

## Solution

The solution incorporates robust error handling within the `useEffect` hook using a `try...catch` block.  If an error occurs, an error message is displayed; otherwise, the fetched data is displayed in the FlatList.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app using your preferred React Native environment.
4. Observe the default behavior (empty FlatList on network error).
5. Examine the solution for improved error handling.
